In foo/foo/ make a settings directory and create an empty __init__.py file inside it.

Move `foo/foo/settings.py` into `foo/foo/settings/base.py`

Create the individual dev.py , stage.py , jenkins.py , and prod.py files in foo/foo/settings/. Each
of these 4 environment specific files should simply contain the following:
`from base import *`


open up foo/foo/settings/prod.py and after the initial import from base just add `DEBUG=False`


./manage.py migrate â€”settings=foo.settings.production
